# GSettings Codegen

Generate rust code from a gschema.

The main purpose of this is to reduce the risk of mistyping a key and
reduce boilerplate rust code. The code generated by this is only meant
as a starting point to generate the code, once. Most of the time, you
will want to tweak the generated code.

It would be better if this was handled by a macro, but here we go.

## Todo list

* Add enum and flags support
* Add other common types support (`a{ss}`, etc.)
* Maybe include default, description, and summary in the generated code?

## Usage

```bash
gsettings-codegen [FILE_PATH] > settings.rs
```

## Running

```bash
cargo run
```

## Example

See `./test.gschema.xml` for sample source GSchema and `./test.rs` for
sample output.
